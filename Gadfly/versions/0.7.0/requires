# Gadfly doesn't use WeakRefString directly but because of a bug in Julia 0.6.2, Gadfly
# will trigger a ambiguity error between WeakRefString methods. A temporary method was
# added in version WeakRefStrings 0.4.3 to work around this. When Gadfly requires at least
# Julia 0.6.3, this dependency can therefore be dropped.
